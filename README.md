# Handwritten digits Recognition
Recognition of handwritten digits based on the famous MNIST dataset

Check the Report for more info about how i proceeded and how it works. (it is in french thought)
The first HandwritingRecog file has the main code for training the model and saving it later on (best used on a Google notebook for server download of the dataset)
the second file has the testing, you can upload a picture of your choice to do the testing, best be black and white so that the model doesnt go crazy. also make sure you upload that very same model you saved from the first notebook. 
I will have a picture available for testing, a number 4 to be exact.
